# AquaNexa - AI-Driven Unified Marine Data Platform

> **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 Submission**

AquaNexa is an **AI-enabled digital platform** that integrates heterogeneous marine datasets across oceanography, fisheries, taxonomy, otolith morphology, and molecular biology (eDNA). It unifies fragmented datasets into a **single, intelligent marine data lake**, enabling advanced analytics, real-time dashboards, and ecosystem-based decision support for scientists, policymakers, and fisheries managers.

## ðŸŒŠ About the Project

Indiaâ€™s **Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE)** collects diverse datasets ranging from **physical oceanography** (temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen, chlorophyll) to **biological data** (fish abundance, taxonomy, otolith images, eDNA sequences). Currently, these datasets are siloed and incompatible, limiting cross-domain research and policy insights.  

**AquaNexa bridges this gap by:**
- **Automated Ingestion & Standardization** of CSV, NetCDF, FASTA, and image formats  
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Morphometrics, DNA matching, and predictive modeling  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of biodiversity and ecosystem health  
- **Cross-Domain Insights**: Correlating ocean parameters with fish distribution & biodiversity  
- **Secure APIs & Natural Language Queries** for open, accessible marine knowledge
